    <p>Mean deviation and standard deviation are both measures of dispersion in statistics, which help us understand how spread out the data points are around a central tendency (like the mean or median). Here's why they exist:

### 1. **Mean Deviation**
   - **Definition**: It is the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean.
   - **Purpose**:
     - Helps quantify the variability in the dataset.
     - Provides a measure of how "spread out" the data points are.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Sensitive to outliers because it uses absolute values.
     - Less commonly used than standard deviation.

### 2. **Standard Deviation**
   - **Definition**: It is the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
   - **Purpose**:
     - Offers a more robust measure of dispersion because squaring the differences eliminates the effect of negative values.
     - Has the same units as the data, making it interpretable.
     - Widespread use in various fields (e.g., finance, science) for risk assessment and normal distribution modeling.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Sensitive to outliers due to squaring.
     - Requires non-negative values.

### Why These Measures Exist
- **To Understand Data Spread**: Both measures help us understand how much the data varies around a central value. This is crucial for making informed decisions and drawing meaningful conclusions.
- **Statistical Inference**: They are fundamental in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, where understanding variability is essential.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allows comparison of datasets with different scales or units (e.g., using z-scores).

In summary, mean deviation and standard deviation exist to provide insights into the spread of data, aiding in better data interpretation and decision-making.</p>
